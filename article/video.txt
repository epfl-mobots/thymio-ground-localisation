Recent progress in electronics has allowed the construction of affordable mobile robots.

This opens many new opportunities, in particular in the educational context.

However, these robots have little long-range sensing abilities, as they are still more expensive than shorter range ones, such as infrared sensors.
This lack has prevented these robots from performing global localization without external aids.

This severely limits their use, for example to teach spatial reasoning or develop artistic activities.

In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem, using only infrared ground sensors, approximate dead-reckoning, and a visual pattern on the ground.

Our approach builds on a recursive Bayesian filter, of which we demonstrate two implementations: a dense Markov Localization and a particle-based Monte Carlo Localization.

Both implementations allow accurate localization on a large variety of patterns, from pseudo-random black and white matrices to grayscale drawings by children.

If kidnapped, the robot will relocalize itself.

These results show that by enabling a new range of educational activities, our solution to the localization of inexpensive robots strongly increases the value of robots for education.
