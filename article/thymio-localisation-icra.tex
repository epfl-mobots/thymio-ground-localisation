\section{Conclusion}

This paper provides several contributions to the state of the art on localization of mobile robots with inexpensive sensors:
\begin{itemize}
\item An empirical evaluation of the performances of Markov- and Monte Carlo-based approaches on real data.
\item A predictive model allowing designers to select and place sensors to achieve a desired localization performance.
\item A process to let end-users to create and provide their own environments, such as drawings made by children.
\end{itemize}
Together, these allow absolute positioning of educational mobile robots in the 100 Euro price range.
This opens many educational opportunities, such as the study of geometry, puzzles based on the physical space, and staging the creation of stories in the context of language education.
These new possibilities are key elements for robots to answer the need for embodied computational thinking education.
