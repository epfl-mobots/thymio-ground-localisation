Notes about transformations
---------------------------

at time 0: x_0, y_0, theta_0
at time 1: x_1, y_1, theta_1

We use homogeneous coordinate, so (x,y) is represented by (x,y,1)

      | cos(theta_0), -sin(theta_0), x_0 |
T_0 = | sin(theta_0),  cos(theta_0), y_0 |
      | 0,             0,            1   |

T_0 is the transformation taking a point in local frame at time 0 at transforming to global frame at time 0, as thought be the Thymio
T_1 is the transformation taking a point in local frame at time 1 at transforming to global frame at time 1, as thought be the Thymio

What do we want for as input for localisation?

T_l is  the transformation taking a point in Thymio local frame at time 1 transforming to Thymio local frame at time 0 ?
From WP [1]: the effect of applying first A and then B to a vector x is given by: (BA)* x

A = T_1, B = inv(T_0)
T_l = inv(T_0) * T_1

Notes about motion model error
------------------------------

There are some notes about that:

From Thrun, Fox & Burgard

\sigma_trans = a_1 * |trans| + a_2 * |rot|
\sigma_rot = a_3 * |trans| + a_4 * |rot|
